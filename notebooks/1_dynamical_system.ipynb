    "## 2. Create an LDS Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linear Dynamical System consists of a continuous state variable, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, which evolves according to linear dynamics.\n",
    "At time-step $t$, we observe an emission (sometimes called an observation) $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$. Similarly, we use $x_t$ to denote the state at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state dynamics obey the following relation (Bishop 2006):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x_t &= A x_{t-1} + V u_{t} + b + w_t \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $b$ is an offset vector, which can drive the dynamics in a particular direction. The vector $u$ represents inputs to the system. Matrix $V$ describes the influence of the input $u$ onto the state variable $x$. These inputs are not recurrent but can be time varying.\n",
    "The term $w$ is a noise term, which perturb the states and observations. \n",
    "Most commonly these are modeled as zero-mean multivariate Gaussians,\n",
    "but one nice feature of SSM is that it supports many distributions for these noise terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We support the following dynamics models, which can be specified by passing an argument to the constructor the LDS class, e.g `dynamics=\"gaussian\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`none`**: Model has no dynamics. At each time-step, the state is drawn independently from a Gaussian. This is the equivalent of filling the dynamics matrix $A$ with zeros.\n",
    "1. **`gaussian`**: Model has linear-gaussian dynamics. $w \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_w )$.\n",
    "1. **`diagonal_gaussian`**: This is a special case of the Gaussian dynamics model where the noise term has diagonal covariance.\n",
    "1. **`studentst`**: $w \\sim t(0, \\Sigma_w, \\nu_w)$. \n",
    "1. **`diagonal_studentst`**: Constrains covariance matrix to be diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify an LDS, we also need to specify how the emissions $y_t$ are generated (the emissions are what we observe). \n",
    "The most common emission model is the simple linear-Gaussian emission model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_t = Cx_t + d + F u_t + v_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this case, $C$ is called the measurement matrix, $d$ is an offset or bias term, and $F$ is called the feedthrough matrix or passthrough matrix (it passes the input directly to the emission).\n",
    "$v_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_v)$ is a noise term, which in the simplest case is Gaussian, but can also be modeled to come from other distributions.\n",
    "We support the following emission models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`gaussian`**: The most common emission model. $y_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(C x_t + d + F u_t, \\Sigma_v)$\n",
    "1. **`studentst`**: Same as above, but uses the Students-T distribution instead of the normal distribution.\n",
    "1. **`poisson`**: Useful for modeling count or event data. Under this model, the observations are nonnegative integers drawn from a poisson distribution (Macke 2011).\n",
    "The latent state controls the rate parameter, in a non-linear fashion as follows. Let $y_{i,t}$ be the $i$-th dimension of our observation at time $t$.\n",
    "We'll also make use of an excitation vector $g_t = C x_t + d + F u_t$, and additionally some nonlinear activation function  $\\eta(\\bullet)$. Exponential or softplus functions are usually a good choice. They avoid passing a negative rate values and are thought to be a good model of turning \"activation\" into spike count.\n",
    "The observations are drawn from a poisson distribution at rates specified by the excitation vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$P( y_{i,t} \\mid g_{i,t}) = \\frac{1}{y_{i,t}!} \\eta(g_{i,t})^{y_{i,t}}\\exp{(-\\eta(g_{i,t}))}.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the mean function is set to $\\exp(\\bullet)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`bernoulli`**:\n",
    "As in the Poisson case, we have an excitation vector $g_t = Cx_t + d + Fu_t$, and a mean function $\\eta(\\bullet)$. In this case, though, the mean function is always the logistic function, becuase its outputs need to be between zero and one. The observations are drawn from a bernoulli distribution where $y_{i,t}$ is 1 with probability $\\eta(g_{i,t})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the above we support orthogonal variants, in which the measurement matrix $C$ is constrained to be orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: SSM supports many other emission models. We are in the process of creating full-standalone documentation to describe them. For now, the best way to learn about SSM's other functionality is look at the source code. The emission models are described in emissions.py._\n",

    "The below line creates an instance of the SSM's `LDS` class:  \n",
    "`true_lds = ssm.LDS(obs_dim, state_dim, dynamics=\"gaussian\", emissions=\"gaussian\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that, we modify the dynamics matrix (the matrix $A$ in the above equations) so that our system will have some interesting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines most relevant for a user of SSM are these:  \n",
