    "The term $w$ is a noise term, which perturb the states and observations. \n",
    "Most commonly these are modeled as zero-mean multivariate Gaussians,\n",
    "but one nice feature of SSM is that it supports many distributions for these noise terms.\n",

    "1. **`none`**: Model has no dynamics. At each time-step, the state is drawn independently from a Gaussian. This is the equivalent of filling the dynamics matrix $A$ with zeros.\n",
    "1. **`gaussian`**: Model has linear-gaussian dynamics. $w \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_w )$.\n",
    "1. **`diagonal_gaussian`**: This is a special case of the Gaussian dynamics model where the noise term has diagonal covariance.\n",
    "1. **`studentst`**: $w \\sim t(0, \\Sigma_w, \\nu_w)$. \n",

    "The latent state controls the rate parameter, in a non-linear fashion as follows. Let $y_{i,t}$ be the $i$-th dimension of our observation at time $t$.\n",
    "We'll also make use of an excitation vector $g_t = C x_t + d + F u_t$, and additionally some nonlinear activation function  $\\eta(\\bullet)$. Exponential or softplus functions are usually a good choice. They avoid passing a negative rate values and are thought to be a good model of turning \"activation\" into spike count (for those that are familiar, this is essentially a type of Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model).

In this case, though, the nonlinearity is always the logistic function, becuase its outputs need to be between zero and one.
