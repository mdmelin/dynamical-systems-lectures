    "# Recurrent SLDS\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This notebook was written as part of the ssm package by Scott Linderman and colleagues, original link is [HERE](https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm/blob/master/notebooks/4-Recurrent-SLDS.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical System (rSLDS) is a generalization of a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) in which the switches in the discrete state are allowed to depend on the value of the continuous state (hence the name recurrent). The rSLDS was developed by Linderman _et al_ in [\"Bayesian Learning and Inference in Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems\"](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/linderman17a.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll give an example of fitting an rSLDS from data, and show that it can learn globally non-linear dynamics. We will focus on using an rSLDS in the context of SSM, and so will skip most of the implementation-level details. For more information on implementation, see the paper above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Generative model for rSLDS\n",
    "The generative model for rSLDS is the same as the SLDS case, except that the discrete state transition probabilities are modulated by the continuous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete State Update**. At each time step, sample a new discrete state $z_t \\mid z_{t-1}, x_{t-1}$ with probabilities driven by a logistic regression on the continuous state: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(z_t = i \\mid z_{t-1} = j, x_{t-1}) \\propto\n",
    "\\exp{\\left( \\log (P_{j,i}) + W_i^T u_t + R_i ^T x_{t-1} \\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $W_i$ is a vector of weights associated with discrete state $i$, that control dependence on an external, known input $u_t$. $R_i$ is again a vector of weights assocaited with state $i$, which weights the contribution from the prior state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous State Update**. Update the state using the dynamics matrix corresponding to the new discrete state:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_t = A_k x_{t-1} + V_k u_{t} + b_k + w_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$A_k$ is the dynamics matrix corresponding to discrete state $k$. $u_t$ is the input vector (specified by the user, not inferred by SSM) and $V_k$ is the corresponding control matrix. The vector $b$ is an offset vector, which can drive the dynamics in a particular direction. \n",
    "The terms $w_t$ is a noise terms, which perturbs the dynamics. \n",
    "Most commonly these are modeled as zero-mean multivariate Gaussians,\n",
    "but one nice feature of SSM is that it supports many distributions for these noise terms. See the Linear Dynamical Systems notebook for a list of supported dynamics models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emission**. We now make an observation of the state, according to the specified observation model. In the general case, the state controlls the observation via a Generalized Linear Model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_t \\sim \\mathcal{P}(\\eta(C_k x_t + d_k + F_k u_t + v_t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$\\mathcal{P}$ is a probabibility distribution. The inner arguments form an affine measurement of the state, which is then passed through the inverse link function $\\eta(\\cdot)$.\n",
    "In this case, $C_k$ is the measurement matrix corresponding to discrete state $k$, $d_k$ is an offset or bias term corresponding to discrete state $k$, $F_k$ is called the feedthrough matrix or passthrough matrix (it passes the input directly to the emission). In the Gaussian case, the emission can simply be written as $y_t = C_k x_t + d_k + F_k u_t + v_t$ where $v_t$ is a Gaussian r.v. See the Linear Dynamical System notebook for a list of the observation models supported by SSM.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below, we create a simulated dataset from a non-linear system, which we'll call the \"Nascar\" dataset. The Nascar dataset is meant to emulate cars going around a track. There are 4 states total: 2 each for driving  along each straightaway, and two for semicircular turns at each end of the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll note that in creating the rSLDS we use **transitions=\"recurrent_only\"**. This means that the transition probabilities are determined only by the previous state (and on the inputs, if present). There is no dependence on the prior $z_t$. Instead, each state simply has a constant bias $r_i$ which biases the transitions toward state $i$. This model is strictly less flexible that the full rSLDS formulation. By setting the weights on the current state to be very large, we make the discrete state transitions essentially deterministic. After creating the rSLDS and sampling a trajectory, we plot the true trajectory below.\n"

We're working on speeding things up in future releases of SSM.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Parameter Learning for rSLDS**  \n",
    "Parameter learning in an rSLDS requires approximate methods. SSM provides two approximate inference algorithms: Black Box Variational Inference (`\"bbvi\"`) and Laplace Variational EM (`\"laplace_em\"`). We don't have the space to describe these methods in detail here, but Black Box Variational Inference was described in [\"Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf) by Blei et al. The Laplace Approximation is described in several sources, but a good reference for the context of state-space models is [\"Estimating State and Parameters in state-space models of Spike Trains,\"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a71e/bf112cabd47cc67284dc8c12ab7644195d60.pdf) a book chapter by Macke et al.  The specific method used in this notebook is described by [\"Zoltowski et al (2020)\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04571).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approximate Posterior Distributions**\n",
    "When using approximate methods, we must choose the form of the distribution we use to approximate the posterior. Here, SSM provides three options:\n",
    "1. `variational_posterior=\"meanfield\"`\n",
    "The mean-field approximation uses a factorized distribution as the approximating posterior. Compatible with the BBVI method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `variational_posterior=\"tridiag\"`\n",
    "This approximates the posterior using a Gaussian with a block tridiagonal covariance matrix, which can be thought of as approximating the SLDS posterior with the posterior from an LDS. Compatible with the BBVI method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `variational_posterior=\"structured_meanfield\"`\n",
    "This assumes a posterior where the join distribution over the continuous and discrete latent states factors as follows. If $q(z,x \\mid y)$ is the joint posterior of the discrete and continuous states given the data, we use the approximation $q(z,x \\mid y) \\approx q(z \\mid y)q(x \\mid y)$, where $q(z \\mid y)$ is the posterior for a Markov chain. Compatible with the Laplace-EM method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling the Fit function in SSM**  \n",
    "All models in SSM share the same general syntax for fitting a model from data. Below, we call the fit function using three different methods and compare convergence. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elbos, posterior = slds.fit(data, method= \"...\",\n",
    "                            variational_posterior=\"...\",\n",
    "                            num_iters= ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the the call to `fit`, method should be one of {`\"bbvi\"`, `\"laplace_em\"`}.  \n",
    "The `variational_posterior` argument should be one of {`\"mf\"`, `\"structured_meanfield\"`}. However, when using Laplace-EM _only_ structured mean field is supported.\n",
    "Below, we fit using four methods, and compare convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Getting the Inferred States\n",
    "For every LDS, SLDS, and rSLDS model in SSM, calling `fit` returns a tuple of `(elbos, posterior)`.  `elbos` is a list containing a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data at each iteration, used to check the convergence of the fitting algorithm. `posterior` is a posterior object (the exact type depends on which posterior is used). The posterior object is used to get an estimate of the latent variables (in this case $x$ and $z$) for each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we use the line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xhat_lem = q_lem.mean_continuous_states[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to get an estimate $\\hat x$ of the continuous state over time. The reason for the index `[0]` is that `posterior.mean_continuous_states` will return a list, where each entry is the posterior for a given trial. In this case, we only have a single trial, so we get the first (and only) element of the list.\n"
